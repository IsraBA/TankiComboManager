# CLAUDE.mds — the detailed docs

One file per area. **Read only what your task needs** — that is the whole point
of the split. `../CLAUDE.md` (loaded automatically) already carries the project
overview and the rules that apply to every task.

| File | Read it when you are… | Contents |
|---|---|---|
| [`conventions.md`](conventions.md) | writing or reviewing **any** code here | comment budget, file headers, modularity, naming, CSS prefix, native look, error handling |
| [`architecture.md`](architecture.md) | touching `manifest.json`, adding a file, or wondering where code may live | the three execution contexts, the 6 manifest blocks and why, load order, namespaces, storage layout, the full source tree |
| [`combos.md`](combos.md) | working on the combos feature — cards, storage shape, randomizer, migration | selectors, the two data generations, the combo-card interaction model, the migrator, languages, the legacy DOM path |
| [`garage-native.md`](garage-native.md) | touching anything that reads or writes the **game's own state** | the ISOLATED/MAIN split, the bridge protocol, discovery anchors, the write path, ownership and lazy-loading traps, behaviours not to regress |
| [`translator.md`](translator.md) | working on the battle-chat translator | the canvas takeover, the two bugs it is shaped around, RTL/bidi, backends, in-game settings, recovery when a build breaks it |
| [`debugging.md`](debugging.md) | something is broken and you need to inspect state | what the console still exposes (`__CMB.*`, `__CT_*`), symptom → cause tables, the offline harnesses |
| [`store.md`](store.md) | releasing, packaging, or changing what the listing claims | CWS hygiene, permissions, packaging rules, the manual test checklist |

Deeper reverse-engineering material (how the anchors were originally derived,
the WebSocket protocol, dead ends) lives outside the extension in
`../../../research/CLAUDE.md`. Everything needed to *work on the extension* is
here.
